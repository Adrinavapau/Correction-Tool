This directory also includes two scripts for performing alignments:

    1. minimap.sh: This script utilizes the Minimap2 tool to align the assembled FASTA file (obtained from HiFiASM) to the raw BAM file, producing an assembled BAM file.

    2. pbmm2.sh: This script uses pbmm2, a tool from Pacific Biosciences, to achieve the same result as minimap.shâ€”aligning the assembled FASTA file to the raw BAM file and generating an assembled BAM file.

Both scripts serve the purpose of aligning assembled sequences to raw data, providing different options for alignment tools.
