Directory Overview

This directory contains three shell scripts, each dedicated to a different tool used for binning contigs:

    1. metabat2.sh: This script outlines the steps required to use the MetaBAT2 tool for binning contigs. It provides a detailed process for generating metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).

    2. macbin.sh: This script utilizes the MaxBin tool for binning. It guides the user through the steps necessary to apply MaxBin to metagenomic data, aiming to improve binning accuracy.

    3. semi.sh: This script is designed for performing binning with the SemiBin tool. It includes the required procedures to use SemiBin for contig binning in metagenomic datasets.

Each script is intended to provide a straightforward way to process metagenomic data using these popular binning tools.
